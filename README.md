## To run the project 
1. yarn to install the node modules,
2. yarn start to run it in browser

## Small brief 
1. Heavily used Typescript in this project.  Typescript is a blessing.  Thanks for making me use it and please let me know if I have used it correctly for my connected       components.
2. On react-native, I have been using redux-saga in the beginning and then revert to redux-thunk as the API code was leaner wrt to our requirements.  Hence, I went with redux-thunk here also.
3. My current background : backend on webMethods -> mobile + php -> iOS -> react-native. Hence, the lack of aesthetics and the use of react-bootstrap.
4. I am also a good student and I would appreciate to have your feedbacks on this project and also what you are actually looking for in a senior at your company.
5. I never actually used JEST concretely in the past as there was not enough time to incorporate it but for the mobile dev part at Wigroup, I will start with using DETOX for end-to-end testing.
6. I have used the default fetch network utility.  I am currently using axios in my projects.
